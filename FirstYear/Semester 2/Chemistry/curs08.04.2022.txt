THERMODYNAMICS

The thermodynamics is the part of chemistry that studies the energy transfer from chemical reaction physical processes.
Thermodynamics deals with the thermodynamic system.

As a system can be considered any region of space separated from its surrounding.

The thermodynamics system is a very big solid body which contains a big number of molecules.

The thermodynamics system can be clasified in function of:

*the first line opens system exchange both matter and energy
*another line (close line) exchanges only energy) so in this case no matter is changed
*the isolated one do not exchange matter or energy with surroundings
*the thermodynamic process represent any process that takes place in the thermodynamic system

The thermodynamics study two types of parameters:

EXTENSIVE PARAMETERS that characterize the thermodynamic system as a wall: ex. mass, temperature, pressure, volumes, nr of moles, total electric charge

INTENSIVE PARAMETERS that have different values in different part of thermodynamic systems.
ex: when the thermodynamic system is compose or contains multiple components.

The studies of relations between the intensive and extensive parameters create the bases of thermodynamics or the basis for thermodynamics law.
The thermodynamic processes can be clasified by the type of parameter that remains constant:
constant - izothermic
unconstant - izobaric

The thermodynamic process can be clasified in function of the parameter that remain constant when the thermodynamic process take place
*The temperature constant - isothermic
*The pressure constant - izobaric
*The volume - izocore
*The heat - adiabatic

When we discuss about a thermodynamic system is necessary to know all the parameters that characterize the thermodynamic state.
The thermodynamic state represents a state of thermodynamic system that can be characterize by different parameters.
State parameters are that type of parameters that can be measured directly: pressure temperature as the state variables are that type
of parameters that is necessary to be calculated with the thermodynamics ecuations.

For example the entropy free/cheap......

0. Principle of thermodynamics its the thermodynamic rule that leads to the definition of temperature.
   The temperature represents the state parameter which determines the transfer of thermal energy between two solid bodies.
   	When two thermodynamics systems are in thermic equilibrium, with the third, then all the three system have the same temperature or
   are in thermic equilibrium.

1. st Principle of thermodynamics explains the conservation law of energy and show the equivalence between the heat and the mechanic work.

The energy is theability of a body or a system to create mechanical work and to change its state of movement.

1ST DEF: It is not possible to construct a machine to generate energy from nothing, that means that is not possible to produce a perpetuum mobile of the machine.
2ST DEF: The total energy of an isolated thermodynamic system is constant during all the processes that take place.
Ei = E - Ep - Ec

The total energy that a system exchanges with surroundings in any process depends only on the initial and final state of the system and not on the way this changing was achieved.
Internal energy of a system can be noted with U and it represents the system energy without the kinetics and potential energy.

dU = dQ + dW (1)

dW = -p -> pressure
     dv -> volume

dU = dQ - pdV

QQ = dU + pdV

The enthalpy H = U + p*v it is internal energy + mechanical work

H = U + pV
dH = dU + p*dV + V*dp
dH = dQ + V*dp
dQ = dH - V*dp


													THERMOCHEMISTRY

THERMOCHEMISTRY studies the heat exchanges that take place for a chemical reaction and can be represented by the enthalpy variation for that reaction.

Lapoesier Laplace

	The heat quantity that can be liberated when a chemical compound is formed from its element is equal with the negative heat quantity that is absorbed whem the chemical compounds
decomposes.

△Hform = △Htransf

Another law in thermodynamics is Hess's Law.

HESS LAW: The change of enthalpy for a thermodynamic system in any process is dependent only on the initial and final state of the thermodynamic system.

In a thermodynamic process if a heat is released the process is called exo-thermic process.
If the heat is absorbed or consumed the process is called endo-thermic process.
For a reaction the enthalpy variation can be calculted as the sum of enthalpy of products- the sum of enthalpy reactants 

A + B -> C + D
△H  = ∑Hprod - ∑Hreact

The second law of thermodynamics:

All the reversible machine that work between the same heat exchange have the same efficiency inspite of the composition of the exchangers.
It is not possible to construct an equipment that would do nothing else than transfer heat from a colder body to a warmer one.

Enthropy (denoted by S) measures the disorder degree from a thermodynamic system.

dS = dQ / T

For a reaction the enthropy reaction can be calculated in the same way as the enthalpy.

△H  = ∑Hprod - ∑Hreact

For the reversible processes the enthropy variation is 0.

													THERMODYNAMIC POTENTIALS

Free energy, free enthalpy.

F = U - TS

If free energy (Helmholdz) variation < 0, the thermodynamic processes are spontaneous.



G = H - T*S
|
v
Gibbs / Free enthalpy

△G = △H - T*△S

i.   If △G < 0, the reaction is a spontaneous one.
ii.  If △G > 0, the reaction is impossible by thermodynamic POV.
iii. If △G = 0, this fact represents the condition of THERMODYNAMICS EQUILIBRIUM (important)!!!!! (△H = T*△S)




The third law of thermodynamics:

It is not possible to pull a physical body to absolute 0 in a finite number of steps.

ENTHROPY OF EVERY CHEMICALLY HOMOGENOUS condensive phase approaches with decresing temperature 0.

Equilibrium state is reached by the thermodynamic system that is isolated from surroundings and let sufficient time to evolve until it is not changing anymore.

△Q = -R*T*lnK

Please show if the following chemical reaction is possible from thermodynamics point of view.
